## Structure

### Nav bar which includes links to Home page, study page and contact which when clicked gives you my direct email. Nav links use a minor blur and fun colors and a small scale up function

### Home page which includes a fun and colorful section in which you can choose between a "quiz" which is about history of bands and a alternative quiz about lyrics calles "bonus game". I have used random color geberator function on mouse enter which changes colors and gives it another little over the top visual effect.

### Footer only has one link and it is for a specially curated playlist on Spotify which user can use to learn about lyrics if he/she have difficulty with bonus game part of the quiz.

### Start button and bonus game takes the user to a quiz which is very easy to navigate. Once in the quiz the question will appear and user will have to select an answer. Depending on wether the answer is correct or not user will know by clicking and seeing the message appearing over the answer itself which will read "correct" or "incorrect". Correct answer will increment the score by one and moving to next question user will know which question number they are on. Once the user completes the quiz the quiz are where questions were displayed will be replaced by innerHTML H1 and H2 informing them about their score. Once that is finished user will be able to press play again which will take them to the main home page where they will be able to select between start game and bonus game again.
